# Java Refresher: Guess the Number Game

This repository contains code for a Java Refresher course, focusing on building a "Guess the Number" game through progressive daily tasks.

## Project Structure

The project follows a phased approach:

- **Day 1 (`Day1_GuessNumber.java`)**: 
  - Focus: Input & Output.
  - Sets up the basic structure with `Scanner` for user input.
  - *Note: This file contains the initial skeleton and TODOs.*

- **Day 2 (`Day2_GuessNumber.java`)**: 
  - Focus: Control Flow (Loops and Conditionals).
  - Implements the game logic:
    - Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
    - Uses a `while` loop to allow multiple guesses.
    - Provides feedback ("Too high", "Too low", "Correct").

- **Workbook (`PHASE_1_WORKBOOK.md`)**:
  - Contains the roadmap and instructions for Phase 1 of the refresher.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Day2_GuessNumber.java
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java Day2_GuessNumber
   ```

## Roadmap

- [x] Day 1: Input & Output
- [x] Day 2: Control Flow
- [ ] Day 3: Object-Oriented Basics
- [ ] Day 4: Inheritance
- [ ] Day 5: Collections
